torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 14.40 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 44.42 GiB of which 12.07 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 32.34 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 18.87 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 12.98 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
